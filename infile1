Structure & Expansion

Krishnarajapuram station has about 4 platforms and 2 thorough tracks for non stopping trains. Most of the long distance trains stop at platform 4, while incoming trains heading to Bangalore City stop at platform 3. Platform 1 is long enough only for eight coaches so it is used for goods and mail trains. [2] And apart from that existing platforms could accommodate only 19 coaches whereas all the trains which stop here have 24 coaches which causes inconvenience to the passengers.[3] So the extension of the platforms were approved by the railways which was completed in fifteen days.[4]
