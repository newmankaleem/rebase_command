Krishnarajapuram railway station is a junction on the Bangalore-Chennai main line with a line from Guntakal joining the track into the station. However the Guntakal track is mostly used by freight trains and oil tankers from Whitefield, though a few express trains from Tamil Nadu and Kerala heading towards the north do use this line, bypassing Bangalore in the process. With the commencement of the Yeshvantapur Railway Station all trains moving towards Bangarpet from Yeshvantapur are given a stop here.
